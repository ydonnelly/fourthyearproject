Fourth Year Project
=================

Project goal
: Assuming known probabilistic models for the receiver synchronisation (timing and
phase) offsets in a digital communications system, are the optimum decision region boundaries at the
detector equivalent to those corresponding to the perfect transmitter-receiver synchronisation case?
