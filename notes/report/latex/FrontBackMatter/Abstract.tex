This report describes a final year project undertaken by the author. The project examined the effects of non-deterministic timing error on digital amplitude-modulated receivers. The background to and the rationale behind the project is given, and the research methodology is discussed. Both an analytical description of the problem and a numerical simulation were explored. It was found that timing error had an attenuating effect on the received signal, and significant performance degradation was observed using traditional receivers. By defining the optimum decision region boundaries for a given timing offset variance, an improved decoder was described. This decoder demonstrated reduced error rates in the presence of timing error compared to decoding assuming perfect synchronisation. Finally, the author suggests a practical implementation and an extension to other cases as two possible continuations to the work described.
