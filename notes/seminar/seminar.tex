\section{\scshape Results}
\subsection{Achievements}
\begin{frame}{Achievements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed models of 4-PAM communications systems in Mathematica
\item Examined performance in non-fading (line-of-sight) environment
\item Examined performance in Rayleigh fading environment with EGC
\item Examined performance in Rayleigh fading environment with MRC
\item Positive results:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Lower optimum decision region boundaries in the presence of timing error
	\item Performance increase from redesigning detector to take this into account
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
