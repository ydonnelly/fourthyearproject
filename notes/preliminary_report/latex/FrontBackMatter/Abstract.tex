This report provides a preliminary summary of a final year project currently being undertaken by the author. The project goals and background are described and an overview is given of the work undertaken to date. A plan of action for the next half of the allocated time period is given. The project has succeeding in demonstrating sub-optimal, correctable receiver performance in the presence of synchronisation errors and the results in the more general case of a fading channel are to be studied next. The report concludes with a brief discussion of the ethical implications of this research.
